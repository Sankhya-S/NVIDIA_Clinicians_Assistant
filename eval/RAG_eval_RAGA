This is part of a broader regimen that includes DIURESIS with Torsemide, additional blood pressure management with Clonidine and Amlodipine, and NHBK (likely referring to Neurohormonal Blockade) with Carvedilol.

Notably, the patient's current presentation without SOB (shortness of breath), CP (chest pain), or palpitations, but with a complaint of burning/itching in lower extremities, suggests that asthma is not currently the primary acute concern. However, the patient's history of cardiac risk factors (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, Coronary artery disease), cardiac history (Secondum ASD, Mild AR), and cerebrovascular disease (status post CVA), alongside extensive intracranial atherosclerosis, necessitates a holistic approach. This includes careful management of medications (e.g., the IV Furosemide given for an unspecified but likely cardiac-related issue, given the proBNP and Cr levels), regular monitoring for signs of cardiac decompensation or stroke, and adjusting asthma management to prevent triggering other conditions. The patient's family history of heart disease and diabetes also warrants close long-term monitoring for early signs of these conditions. Physical exams, like the one documented, are crucial for ongoing assessment, particularly focusing on the patient's comfort, distress levels, and specific systemic evaluations (e.g., HEENT, Lymphatic).",custom_multi_hop_query_synthesizer,ERROR: 'metadata_analysis',"['Past Medical History:\n1.

This finding, coupled with the clinical context (e.g., edema, the presence of endotracheal tubes suggesting respiratory support), supports the concern for aspiration or pneumonia.

The increased CK-MB levels (6 and 7) here could imply worsening cardiac function or additional cardiac stress, though the heart size is described as only top-normal.           **Implications and Considerations:**      - The fluctuations in CK-MB levels, particularly the increase observed in the subsequent measurements, warrant close monitoring of cardiac function.      - The correlation between CK-MB levels and cardiac silhouette size/pulmonary vascular congestion suggests that as CK-MB increases, there is a noticeable, though mild, impact on cardiac function and pulmonary vascular status.      - Further diagnostic workup, including but not limited to serial CK-MB measurements, detailed cardiac imaging (e.g., more frequent TTE), and clinical assessment, is crucial for accurately determining the prognosis and guiding management.",custom_multi_hop_query_synthesizer,ERROR: 'metadata_analysis',"['LFTs\n___ 09:10AM BLOOD ALT-31 AST-25 AlkPhos-111 TotBili-<0.2\n___ 07:44AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-531*\n___ 07:00AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-509*\n\nCARDIAC ENZYMES:\n___ 09:10AM BLOOD proBNP-1140*\n___ 07:44AM BLOOD CK-MB-7 c', '# Chest pain: \nNo known history of CAD.
